        Dopamine Menu is designed to help you track and balance your daily activities
        that stimulate motivation, pleasure, and satisfaction. It’s based on the idea
        of managing dopamine, which is the brain’s “reward chemical”, in a healthy and productive way.

        This concept was first introduced by Jessica MCcabe to help ADHD people to manage
        their Dopamine levels on daily basis. It consist of 5 main categories which are
        1. Entrees - Quick wins
        2. Main - Satisfying activities for deep fulfillment
        3. Specials - Occasional activities
        4. Sides - Small additions to major tasks
        5. Desserts - Sweet treats

        You can create custom categories, add personal goals, track habits, and monitor
        your progress over time. The app encourages mindful use of dopamine by replacing
        instant gratification with meaningful, goal-driven actions.

        By using Dopamine Menu, you build awareness of what truly energizes and fulfills
        you, helping you rewire your reward system for long-term happiness.</string>
